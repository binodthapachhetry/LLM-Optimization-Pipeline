 ## Data Flow                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                       
 1. **Configuration Loading**: The pipeline starts by loading and validating the configuration.                                                                                        
 2. **Model Loading**: The initial model is loaded based on the configuration.                                                                                                         
 3. **Stage Execution**: Each stage in the pipeline is executed sequentially.                                                                                                          
 4. **State Passing**: The model state is passed between stages, with each stage updating it.                                                                                          
 5. **Metrics Collection**: Metrics are collected from each stage and aggregated.                                                                                                      
 6. **Result Saving**: The final model and metrics are saved to the specified output directory.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                       
 ## Extension Points                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                       
 The system is designed to be extended in several ways:                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                       
 1. **New Optimization Techniques**: Create a new class that inherits from `OptimizationStage` and implement the `run()` method.                                                       
 2. **Custom Evaluators**: Create a new class that inherits from `Evaluator` and implement the `evaluate()` method.                                                                    
 3. **Custom Data Processors**: Create a new class that inherits from `DataProcessor` and implement the required methods.                                                              
 4. **New Benchmarks**: Add new benchmarking methods to the `BenchmarkingStage` class.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
 ## Performance Considerations                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                       
 - **Memory Usage**: Some optimization techniques (e.g., full fine-tuning) may require significant memory.                                                                             
 - **Computation Time**: Certain operations (e.g., distillation) may be computationally expensive.                                                                                     
 - **Storage Requirements**: Saving multiple versions of models can require substantial disk space.                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                       
 ## Limitations and Future Work
