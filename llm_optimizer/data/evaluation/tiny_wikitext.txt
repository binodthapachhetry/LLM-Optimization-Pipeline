The artificial intelligence revolution has transformed how we interact with technology. Large language models can now generate human-like text, translate languages, and even write code. These systems learn from vast amounts of data, identifying patterns that allow them to predict and generate text that appears to understand context and meaning.

Neural networks form the backbone of modern AI systems. These computational structures, inspired by the human brain, consist of layers of interconnected nodes that process information. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses neural networks with many layers to analyze complex patterns in data. This approach has proven remarkably effective for tasks ranging from image recognition to natural language processing.

Despite their impressive capabilities, large language models face significant challenges. They can generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information, reflect biases present in their training data, and consume substantial computational resources. Researchers continue to work on addressing these limitations while expanding the potential applications of these powerful tools.
